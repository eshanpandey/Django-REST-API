# Simple Django REST API

## Overview

Welcome to the Simple Django REST API project! This repository provides a hands-on exploration of building a basic RESTful API using the Django web framework. Whether you're new to Django or looking to solidify your understanding of API development, this project serves as a foundational example.

## Key Features

1. **GET Request Endpoint:**
   - Retrieve data from the server using the implemented GET request endpoint.

2. **POST Request Endpoint:**
   - Submit data to the server through the POST request endpoint, demonstrating write operations.

3. **Django Models:**
   - A basic Django model defines the structure of the API resource, showcasing the power of Django's object-relational mapping.

4. **Serializers:**
   - Django serializers handle the conversion of data types, essential for both GET and POST requests.

5. **Django REST Framework:**
   - Integration with Django REST Framework streamlines API development, providing tools to simplify common tasks.
